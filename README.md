New Horizons is an innovative carpooling project designed specifically for events. It provides a platform where event organizers can list their upcoming events, and individuals who do not have access to a car can find drivers heading to the same event and secure a ride. The goal of New Horizons is to facilitate convenient and sustainable transportation options for event attendees while reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions.

With New Horizons, event organizers can create event listings, providing details such as the date, time, and location of the event. Drivers who are planning to attend these events can sign up and offer available seats in their vehicles. They can specify their departure location, preferred route, and the number of passengers they can accommodate.

On the other hand, individuals who are interested in attending these events but do not have their own means of transportation can browse the available events on the New Horizons platform. They can search for events based on location, date, or event type and see a list of drivers heading to each event. The platform provides information about the driver, including their departure location, estimated arrival time, and the number of available seats in their vehicle.

Once a passenger finds a suitable driver and event, they can request a seat through the platform. The driver will receive the request and can accept or decline based on their preferences. If accepted, the passenger and driver can coordinate further details, such as the meeting point and any cost-sharing arrangements.

New Horizons aims to foster a sense of community by connecting people with shared interests and providing a convenient and cost-effective way to travel to events. By utilizing carpooling, it encourages resource optimization, reduces traffic congestion, and promotes environmentally friendly transportation alternatives.
